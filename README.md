This Chrome extension replaces all instances of US President Donald Trump's name with the phrase "Not My President" in protest against his hateful and corrupt campaign and presidency. 
Additionally, accessible web images with sources containing his name will be replaced with an image of a Cheeto - a reference to a pejorative nickname for the President.
